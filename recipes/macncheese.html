    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is one of the first recipes that I tried out from the Instapot
        cook book that Nicole got me for Xmas 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
        My first attempt went ok. The recipe calls for an absurd amount of 
        cheese. I added half of what was supposed to be included and it was 
        still insanely greasy. So that's something I'd note for the future.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mac</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>4 cups of chicken broth</li>
        <li>Additional cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the oil and milk in the instapot</li>
        <li>
            Add in the chicken broth. Remember 1 teaspoon of concentrated boullion in
            1 cup of water is equivalent to 1 cup of broth.
        </li>
        <li>Pressure cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the grated cheese until your arms are ready to fall off.</li>
    </ol>
